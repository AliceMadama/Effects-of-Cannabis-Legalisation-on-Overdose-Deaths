# Effects Of Cannabis Legalisation on the Opioid Epidemic
Official Project Repository for Computational Social Sciences

Michigan has been a trailblazer for Cannabis legalization in the United States. Initially it was only permitted for medical purposes.
However, with the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act of 2018, it is now also available for recreational use.
The potential benefits and drawbacks of marijuana legalization are constantly discussed in diverse legal, medical, and sociological
domains. Would it have a positive impact on our society, or would the negative aspects outweigh the positives? In this study, we
focus on the age-long stereotype that views Cannabis as a “getaway drug” for opioid addiction. Through the use of both inferential
and descriptive statistics, we observe the overdose levels, prior to and after the enactment of the Law, and conclude whether the
legalization of this substance has caused a raise in the overdose rates in Michigan
